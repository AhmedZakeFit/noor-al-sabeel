# Changelog

All notable changes to Noor Al-Sabeel are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-10-23

### Changed

- App renamed to **Noor Al-Sabeel** (نور السبيل). New display name in English and Arabic
  across the app, notifications and documentation. No feature or behaviour changes.
- Repository renamed to `AhmedZakeFit/noor-al-sabeel`; old links redirect automatically.
- Release APK asset is now named `noor-al-sabeel-<version>.apk`.

### Compatibility

- The application ID stays `io.github.ahmedzakefit.noor` and the signing certificate is
  unchanged, so this update installs directly over v1.0.0 with settings and data preserved.
